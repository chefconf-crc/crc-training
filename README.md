# Crafting Reusable Cookbooks Training - Chef Conf 2016

Are you trying to build cookbooks within your organization but are unclear about how to get your coworkers involved? Maybe you've learned the Chef primitives and architecture but you're not sure how to distill that knowledge into patterns that others can follow? In this collaborative workshop, we will spend the day working together to craft a community cookbook from scratch using both Chef and community resources. In the process, we'll learn some key patterns of DevOps practices.

You'll also learn about:
* Application deployment planning.
* Introducing repeatable, testable change.
* Measuring impact and quality.
