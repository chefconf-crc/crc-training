## Background
The Artifactory cookbook is an attribute driven cookbook that installs Jfrogâ€™s Artifactory. The cookbook does not do configuration of artifactory, as the expectation is that Artifactory will be configured bia the UI.

## About Artifactory
Artifactory is a universal Artifact Repository Manager that fully supports software packages created by any language or technology including management of secure, clustered, high availability Docker registries, Yum repositories, and Gemstores.

Artifactory supports full integration with nearly all CI/CD tools in the wild and provides an automated end-to-end solution for tracking artifacts from development to production.
