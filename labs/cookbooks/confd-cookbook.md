## Background

The confd cookbook is a library cookbook that provides the means to install and configure the confd lightweight configuration management service.

## About confd
Confd is a lightweight configuration management whose primary focus is keeping local configuration files up-to-date. Confd integrates with service discovery and nosql databases to pull data or can utilize env vars to process and reload template resources. 

In practice, confd enables a system to autonomously and dynamically pick up configuration file changes from these data sources and then reload the application that consumes them allowing for a more lightweight and reactive and agile system behavior.
