## Background

The Consul Cookbook is a library cookbook that provides means to install and configure the consul distributed key/value store.

## About Consul
Consul is a distributed key value store that provides a reliable way to store data across a cluster of machines, generally referred to as a "service discovery‚Äù system.

There are several other open source service discovery projects in the wild including etcd and zookeeper. While these implementations are drastically different, they seek to achieve the same purpose. If you are unfamiliar with consul but familiar with the former or latter then you (should) have a common vocabulary for the technology.
