## Background

The Golang cookbook is a library cookbook for installing and configuring the go programming language and toolset.

## About Golang

Go is a modern, concurrent, open-source programming language with fast compilation for building simple, reliable and efficient software. Go provides a model for software construction that makes dependency analysis easy and avoids much of the overhead of C-style include files.

At its heart it is an attempt to combine the ease of programming a dynamically typed language with the efficiency and memory safety of a statically type, or compiled, language.
