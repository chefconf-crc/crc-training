## Background

The graphite cookbook is an attribute driven library cookbook that provides the means to install and configure graphite with Chef.

## About Graphite
Graphite is a highly scalable real-time graphing system. Specifically, Graphite is designed to handle numeric time-series data.

For example, Graphite would be good at graphing stock prices because they are numbers that change over time. Whether itâ€™s a few data points, or dozens of performance metrics from thousands of servers.

What Graphite does not do is collect this data for you. It expects this data injection from external applications which makes it highly flexible and easy to integrate to a considerably diverse application set.
