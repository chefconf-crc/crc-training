## Background

The Marathon cookbook is an application cookbook that provides a means for simple installation and configuration of Mesosphere's Marathon.

## About Marathon

Marathon is an Apache Mesos framework for container orchestration that provides a REST API for starting, stopping, and scaling applications. As such it is commonly referred to as a meta-framework.

It can be utilized to run other Mesos frameworks such as Chronos or Storm to ensure they survive machine failures. Marathon can also be used to deploy more marathon instances!
