## Background

The Nginx cookbook is a library cookbook that provides a means for installation of nginx from Packages or source code. It also supplies a consumer with the ability to set up configuration handling similar to Debianâ€™s Apache2 scripts.

## About Nginx

Nginx is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server. It has the ability (like other HTTP servers) to provide, static and index files, keeplive and pipelined connections, as well as name and IP based virtual servers.

Unlike some counterparts Nginx also provides generic proxying of TCP and UDP, SSL termination for TCP and baked in Load balancing. It does an excellent job of functioning as the web front-end or load balancer in common application architectures (LAMP, LNMP).
