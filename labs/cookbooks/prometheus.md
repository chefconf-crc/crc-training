## About Prometheus

Prometheus is a systems and service monitoring system. It collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed to be true.

Prometheus has a rich feature足set that set it apart from other monitoring tools including the utilization of a multi足dimensional data model and its own flexible query language. Prometheus has highly flexible exportation available for its data and several integrations available out of box.

In practice Prometheus provides something important for modern infrastructure monitoring which is specifically precision alerting based upon important metrics and not simply return codes.
