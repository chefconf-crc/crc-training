## Background

The rkt Cookbook is a library cookbook concerned specifically with the installation and management of the rkt container platform as developed by CoreOs, Inc.. It's *important* to note that this cookbook is primarily developed on gitlab and then mirrored back to github.

## About rkt
Rkt is an open source project for packing, shipping and running applications in compose-able containers. (Imagine Docker or LXC).

Rkt containers are very similar to docker containers but along with “Docker Images”, rkt can also download and run “App Container Images” (ACIs) specified by the App Container Specification (appc).
